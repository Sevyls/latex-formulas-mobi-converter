## Requirements

## Java 7 or higher

You need to have the Java Runtime Environment installed in order to run this software.
Download Java here: [http://www.java.com](http://www.java.com/)

### Pandoc 1.12 or higher
This software makes great use of pandoc's LaTeX to HTML converter. 

Download & install from [http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)

**Add the installed pandoc executable/directory to your operating system's PATH variable.**

##### OR: config file

Inside the config file "*configuration.properties*" you can define a permanent  
> pandoc.exec = "file:///opt/pandoc-1.12.4.2/pandoc"

##### OR: CLI arguments

Ad-hoc configuration is possible by passing the following *optional* command line argument:

> -p / --pandoc-exec <pandoc-filepath>

Notice: this overrides all other previous discussed settings.

### Amazon KindleGen

This is the standard way to generate a .Mobi-File.

Download & install from [http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211)

**Add the installed kindlegen executable/directory to your operating system's PATH variable.**


## Build-Requirements

### Java Development Kit (JDK) 7 or higher

This software uses the Java SE JDK 7.

* Download & install from here [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

### Maven

This project is built with Maven 3.3.x

* Download & install from here [http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)



## Conversion strategy

A short explanation about the main conversion strategy:

### 1. Main document structure conversion (without formulas)

Initially pandoc converts the LaTeX document input file to HTML5.
The complete LaTeX code will be transformed into an HTML representation, **except for the formulas**.
We use Pandoc's options just to mark the formulas with a "LaTeX" HTML class.
Rendering of other document parts is up to pandoc alone.

### 2. Converting all formulas from LaTeX to MathML with SnuggleTeX

In order to transform your LaTeX formulas for displaying inside a Mobi-/Kindle Format-Ebook,
we have to generate markup. Best known for its presentation markup is MathML.
This project makes heavy use of **SnuggleTeX** to parse LaTeX **Formulas** and generate MathML2.

#### LaTeX Support Notes

##### Note: SnuggleTeX only supports a subset of LaTeX:
http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/snuggletex/documentation/supported-latex.html

##### Note: SnuggleTeX requires clean LaTeX syntax

for correct parsing!

i.e.: LaTeX Command Arguments *have to be correctly surrounded by curly brackets* like:

This Command works: `\newcommand{\rfrac}[2]{{}^{#1}\!/_{#2}}`

**DOES NOT WORK:** `\newcommand\rfrac[2]{{}^{#1}\!/_{#2}}`

### 3. Transforming all formulas from MathML to pure HTML markup and applying a static stylesheet

At this step, every formula has been transformed into MathML which will be rendered to a pure HTML+CSS output.
The converter replaces each LaTeX formula with the resulting Markup.

#### Info:
As of today the Kindle devices and apps do not support rendering of MathML of any kind.
This software package makes reasonable assumptions for rendering MathML with the Mobi/Kindle Format *supported
subset* of HTML5 + CSS3.
On Kindle devices or apps, you **can not** use any JavaScript or other DOM processing languages.


### 4. Converting the resulting HTML document to the MOBI-Format

The last step for completion is the step to convert the HTML+CSS into a readable Mobi-Ebook.

Note: Currently there is only an HtmlToMobiConverter-Implementation which uses Amazon's Kindlegen Executable.
