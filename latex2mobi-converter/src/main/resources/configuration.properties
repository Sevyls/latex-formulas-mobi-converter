###### External Tools ######
# If an external tool is not found in the system's PATH variable, you have to specify the location.
# One way to do this is by passing a CLI argument, otherwise you can configure it here:

### pandoc

# Windows example
# pandoc.exec = "E:\Users\Person\AppData\Local\Pandoc\pandoc.exe"
# pandoc.exec = "file:///C:/pandoc/pandoc.exe"

# POSIX (Mac, Linux) example
# pandoc.exec = "/home/person/pandoc-1.12.4.2/pandoc"
# pandoc.exec = "file:///opt/pandoc-1.12.4.2/pandoc"
